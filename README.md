# Hi there 👋

I'm Daniel (he/him). I am an experienced leader in the Ops/Platform/DevOps/SRE space with a passion for people AND technology. 

### My Background 🕰️

My professional journey started in a classical IT operations role in 2000, managing systems for an online Bank. I've traversed through big corporates and small startups, and I'm currently working for [Gini](https://gini.net), a German FinTech, and I'm in charge of the platform and IT. My responsibility is to enable cross-functional product teams with a platform based on Kubernetes for fast and reliable delivery. Millions of people use the platform in Europe each month.

## I'm passionate about ✨

  - Leadership, especially in the context of self-organization
  - coaching, growing, and enabling people
  - the cloud-native ecosystem
  - programming in Go
  - becoming a better version of myself

## Technologies I 💙

  - OS
    - Server: Linux. Primarily Debian-based, but I have a seasoned history with other flavors like Gentoo, too 😏
    - Client: Apple MBP 🍏
  - Cloud Provider
    - AWS. It is my daily work, and I also had some exposure to GCP. Not used Azure yet
  - Kubernetes
    - I've been using it for years on bare-🤘 and the ☁️, and it has served me well
    - CNI: Cilium. eBPF is the future, and the stuff the folks at Isovalent do is just amazing 🍯
  - Monitoring
    - Sysdig Monitor & Secure. The products are getting better every day, and the kernel integration may really open your eyes 👀
    - Prometheus. It's the cloud-native way, and it is also nicely integrated into Sysdig 😏
  - Observability
    - Honeycomb: Delightful to implement and crazy powerful 🐝 
  - Networking
    - VPN: Tailscale. Not even a question. One of the simplest and yet most exciting technologies there is
    - L2/L3: Comfortable with both
    - BGP: It can be fun. Use it primarily in bare-🤘 setups. FRRouting, kube-router & cilium work great
  - Programming
    - Golang: It has been my language of choice for quite a while now, and I've created several tools and libraries at Gini
    - Python: Mostly for more straightforward tasks and one-offs
    - Bash: You can get pretty far with it
